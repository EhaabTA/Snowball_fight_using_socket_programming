# Snowball_fight_using_socket_programming

This is a Snowball fight game is coded using python and socket programming is used so that multiple users can play the game, socket programming is done by using the "Socket.io" library. This game consist of multiple players, each with the one goal i.e. to throw and hit the snowball to others before getting hit themselves. The graphics is obtained from a file from an application called "Tiles". As for the character i used my unversity's logo XD.

For running the code, i use "npm run dev" in VS CODE.
